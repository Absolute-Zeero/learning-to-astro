# Hello, world!

Published on: 2023-09-16

This is the first of the projected 3 blog posts I'll make on this website before I completely forget about it. Honestly learning it's not that bad! The tutorial's pretty clear and I know enough to adlib a little bit, if you wanna call it that.

## Alright but what'd you do exactly?

1. **"""""""Installing""""""" Astro**: I made a new Astro project and dumped it into a GitHub repo that funnels down into a netlify free website. I didn't really install anything myself, this is edited entierly on a web client. Wow!
2. **I wrote a page :)**: I plopped some text into some html files to make a very basic site with no formatting. I'll eventually design it I promise.
3. **I made this? I made this.**: Hey I made this post. Original Content do not steal.

## We're _so_ proud now what?

I'm gonna finish the tutorial now this was fun to write.
